## Creating a Venn Diagram in R

### Synopsis
A Venn Diagram is a visualization used to show similarities across two or more datasets.  It has many uses in computing.

Briefly, there are two ways to create a Venn Diagram.  You can provide a matrix or list to R, and it perform the calculations for you, or you can do the calculations elsewhere and provide the area values.  Depending on what you are doing, you may want to do one or the other option.

For more information, a helpful user manual is at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VennDiagram/VennDiagram.pdf

The code is contained in an R script that can be opened and run in R or R Studio.
